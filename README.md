# WebGL Django Channels

Multi-player First Person Shooter! Created using Django Channels with WebGL. Visit "35.227.22.25:8000" to play it yourself!
As many players can join into the same session as the server will allow. Dodge bullets and be prepared for the map to shift at a moment's notice. Django supplies the backend while Javascript (WebGL) handles the rasterized 3D graphics.

Use Firefox to prevent lag. Chrome and Opera do not run well with WebGL and I have not tested on Internet Explorer.

Arrow keys to move, 'E' to shoot, 'Space' to jump. Give it some time to load.
